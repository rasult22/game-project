            The BizzonGames (hereinafter referred to as “Project”, “Platform”)
            is a brand new face in the universe of crypto games. It acts as a
            playground with different games based on the blockchain technology
            listed on it. The Playground provides its users with access to
            different games and gaming products to suit any taste, supporting
            all the cryptogaming features. In addition to listing gaming
            products from different developers our platform has its own team of
            developers creating games exclusively for our Platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Platform provides a number of services for a third-party game
            projects regarding the provision of information on these game
            products, as well as their popularization. The Platform’s aggregator
            section provides the ultimate list of statistics regarding any game
            listed on the Platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            Among the functions of the Platform there are opportunities to
            promote games, including the development of marketing plans,
            attracting funding for their development/upgrade, and providing
            access for game developers to a wide range of tools aimed at
            strengthening their game products. The team of developers involved
            in the project has extensive experience in game production (> 15
            years) and creates first-class games exclusively for our users.

          <p>
            Today’s gaming sector based on tokenized games is reaching greater
            heights of popularity. In the face of such hype, players have to
            spend their time playing primitive “tap”-games in pursuit of in-game
            rewards. Our project solves the problem of monotony of game offers
            by creating an opportunity to choose which games our users want to
            earn in. The rewards are not limited but mostly presented as in-game
            tokens. The team of our developers offers to our users an
            opportunity to dive into more intelligent and non-monotonous games
            with the fairest rewards for participation and achievements.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, our platform aims to provide as much gaming content as
            possible to suit all the different tastes, which translates into
            attracting more games from third-party developers.
